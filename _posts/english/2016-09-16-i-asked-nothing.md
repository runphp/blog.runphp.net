I asked nothing  | 我一无所求
-----|---
I asked nothing, only stood at the edge of the wood behind the tree.  | 我一无所求，只站在林边树后。
Languor was still upon the eyes of the dawn, and the dew in the air. | 倦意还逗留在黎明的眼上，露润在空气里。
The lazy smell of the damp grass hung in the thin mist above the earth. | 湿草的懒味悬垂在地面的薄雾中。
Under the banyan tree you were milking the cow with your hands, tender and fresh as butter. | 在榕树下你用乳油般柔嫩的手挤着牛奶。
And I was standing still.  | 我沉静地站立着。
I did not say a word. It was the bird that sang unseen from the thicket. | 我没有说出一个字。那是藏起的鸟儿在密叶中歌唱。
The mango tree was shedding its flowers upon the village road, and the bees came humming one by one.  | 芒果树在树径上撒着繁花，蜜蜂一只一只地嗡嗡飞来。
On the side of the pond the gate of Shiva's temple was open and the worshipper had begun his chants.  | 池塘边湿婆天的庙门开了，朝拜者开始诵经。
With the vessel on your lap you were milking the cow. | 你把罐儿放在膝上挤着牛奶。
I stood with my empty can. | 我提着空桶站立着。
I did not come near you. | 我没有走近你。
The sky woke with the sound of the gong at the temple. | 天空和庙里的锣声一同醒起。
The dust was raised in the road from the hoofs of the driven cattle. | 街尘在驱走的牛蹄下飞扬。
With the gurgling pitchers at their hips, women came from the river. | 把汩汩发响的水瓶搂在腰上，女人们从河边走来。
Your bracelets were jingling, and foam brimming over the jar. | 你的钏镯丁当，乳沫溢出罐沿。
The morning wore on and I did not come near you. | 晨光渐逝而我没有步近你。
